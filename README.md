This is only a script to industrialize the reinstallation of my workstation.
It should be run once and you need some action post install.

Here is to install :

### git clone https://github.com/ryersacl/FedoraWorkstation.git
### cd FedoraWorkstation
### bash install.sh

The script is interactive and ask your pass or become-pass (your account password) for install packet through playbook ansible.

I'm only a student/newbie and work for learn and try to make thing into linux/devops :)
